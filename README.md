  # Figures

  ## Fig. 1: Single Parameter Variation
  ![single_parameter_variation](https://github.com/gonal002/AEM3103/assets/167819730/d019e017-c8cf-4695-935c-72e6a452ae40)

  This figure contain 2 subplots of 2D Flight Trajectories. The top one shows how 3 different speeds affect trajectorie and lower one does the same thing, now varying Gamma.

  ## Fig. 2: Monte Carlo Simulation

  This figure contains 100 plots of flight trjectories that vary both Gamma(Flight Path Angle) and Velocity in the bounds defined on the previous plot. It contains too a majenta plot that is a polynomial of 4th order fitted using the 'polyfit' MATLAB command. 

 ## Fig. 3: Time Derivatives
 <Time-derivative of height and range for the fitted trajectory>

  Briefly describe what is being shown in the figure.
